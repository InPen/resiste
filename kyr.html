          <li>If officers are at your door, keep the door closed at ALL times and ask if they are Immigration agents, or from ICE.</li>
          <li>Ask the agents what they are there for.</li>
          <li>If the agents don’t speak your language, ask for an interpreter.</li>
          <li>If the agents want to enter, ask them if they have a warrant signed by a judge.</li>
          <li>If ICE agents do not have a warrant signed by a Judge, you may refuse to open the door. A warrant of removal from immigration authorities is not enough.</li>
          <li>If they say they have a warrant, ask them to slip the warrant under the door.</li>

          <li>Look at the top and at the signature line to see if it was issued by a court and signed by a judge. Only a court/judge warrant is enough for entry into your premises.</li>
          <li>If the valid warrant was issued by a court and authorizes a search of your house, you should let the officer in the house.</li>
          <li>If the valid warrant looks like it was issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) but not a court, you have the right not to let the officer enter your house.</li>

            </div>


          <li>If the warrant authorizes your arrest but not a search of your house, you may want to go outside to meet the officers but not let them in the house. * This is especially important if you live with other people who might have immigration problems, because once you allow the officer into your house, he can ask questions of anyone else who is there, too.</li>
          <li>If agents force their way in anyway, do not attempt to resist. If you wish to exercise your rights, state: “I do not consent to your entry or to your search of these premises. I am exercising my right to remain silent. I wish to speak with a lawyer as soon as possible.”</li>
          <li>Do not lie or show false documents. Do not sign any papers without speaking to a lawyer.</li>
