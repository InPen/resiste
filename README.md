# resiste

This is the first big project I built after finishing my 12-week-intense-bootcamp program with [Resilient Coders](https://resilientcoders.org).
*Resist√©* is a Front end application catered towards the undocumented community. Here, users can access information about their rights in the United States, and read information as to how prevent|stop a deportation.

Note: I had no previous coding experience and my bootcamp was Front end focused so I used [Phone Gap](https://phonegap.com) in order to transform my SPA into a cool looking application.
